# Secure Coding Lab and Static Analysis using LLVM Clang Static Analyzer

This repository contains the vulnerable codebase for the Secure Coding Project. 

### Points to be Noted:

- The code base is written in C.
- We identify the vulnerabilites in the code, map them to the corresponding CWE weakness.
- Fix the vulnerablites and include the fix in the [report](https://github.com/namruth/Secure_coding/blob/main/namruth_report_secure_coding.pdf)
